# TDTEEG
MATLAB codes for EEG and photometry data processing generated by the TDT system

Detect sleep states from EEG and EMG data, then align sleep states with photometry signals

Coded by Yueqing Peng

## Requirement
MATLAB 2019 and later, deep learning toolbox

The suite needs MATLAB packages from Tucker-David Technologies (TDT), which can be downloaded from the vendor

## Set up
Add TDTbin2mat to the Path

Add eglib to the Path

## how to run
* Run tdtEEGgui.m to generate a GUI panel

* Click Open Folder to open the data folder

* Change parameters if needed (e.g. EEG and/or photometry channel, process time window, EEG/EMG filters)

* Click View Data to load the data 

* Click Analyse to process EEG, EMG and photometry data

* Enable Manual-score in Function, use Manual scoring to review wake/sleep states if needed

* Click Save to save results in a xxx.mat file
